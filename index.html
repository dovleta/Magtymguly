      <h3>Early life and education</h3>
        <section id="Early life">
          <P>Magtymguly is thought to have been born in Hajygowshan, a village near Gonbad-e Qabus city in the modern-day province of Golestan, Iran, the northern steppes of which are known as Turkmen Sahra ("Turkmen steppes"). In his poetry, Magtymguly says; "Tell those who enquire about me that I am a Gerkez, I hail from Etrek and my name is Makhtumkuli",[25] identifying his homeland as the banks of the Etrek River and expressing his identity through his tribe.</p>

          <P>Magtymguly received his early education in the Persian and Arabic languages from his father Döwletmämmet Azady, a leading Turkmen scholar. His mother's name was probably Orazgül, though this claim is not universally accepted.[27] Magtymguly studied in various madrassahs, including Idris Baba madrassah in the village of Gyzyl Aýak, Şirgazy madrassah in Khiva and "Gögeldaş" madrassah in Bukhara.</P>

      <h3>Later life</h3>
        <section id="Later life">
          <p>After returning home, Magtymguly worked as a silversmith, and taught and wrote poetry.[30] He developed a realistic style of writing about 18th-century Turkmens that became very popular and led to him becoming one of the most cherished Turkmen poets of all time. He was a devout naqshbandi sufi who was said to have travelled throughout all of the lands comprising modern Turkmenistan, teaching and praying for the salvation of his people.[31] His strong religiosity and deep sense of spirituality are found in poems such as "Gaşy ýaý" and "Söýmüşem seni".</p>
